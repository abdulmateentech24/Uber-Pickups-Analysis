# Uber-Pickups-Analysis
This project analyzes Uber pickup data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to ride demand across different times, locations, and days.
The analysis helps understand rider behavior, identify peak hours, and visualize geographical hotspots, which can be useful for decision-making in urban planning, traffic management, and ride-hailing services.
